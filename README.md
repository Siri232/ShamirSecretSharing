Explanation of the Code:
Input Parsing:

Reads the JSON file using the JSONParser from org.json.simple.
Extracts the number of roots (
𝑛
n) and the minimum required roots (
𝑘
k).
Decoding 
𝑦
y-Values:

Iterates over the JSON objects and decodes 
𝑦
y-values from their respective bases using BigInteger.
Lagrange Interpolation:

Uses the formula:

L(0).
Output:

Prints the calculated constant term.
Features:
Uses BigInteger for handling large coefficients and values.
Reads from JSON input, ensuring flexibility for various test cases.
Implements Lagrange Interpolation efficiently for the constant term.
Assumptions:
The JSON file is well-formed and adheres to the specified structure.
All values are positive integers within a reasonable range for computational efficiency.
